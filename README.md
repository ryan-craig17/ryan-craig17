# Occupation
I'm a data geek by trade looking to break into full-stack development in my spare time. 
At my current job I am using SQL, R, and Python as tools for various data analysis, maintaining data integrity, and ensuring consistent data quality.


# Interests
Currently, I am learning .NET CORE and React with hopes of Azure and AWS deployment. 

I would greatly appreciate any help with Web Development. (Or if you have any expert tips on SQL, R, or Python!)
